We describe a simple and solvable model of a device that – like the “neat-ﬁngered being” in
Maxwell’s famous thought experiment – transfers energy from a cold system to a hot system by
rectifying thermal ﬂuctuations. In order to accomplish this task, our device requires a memory
register to which it can write information: the increase in the Shannon entropy of the memory
compensates the decrease in the thermodynamic entropy arising from the ﬂow of heat against a
thermal gradient. We construct the nonequilibrium phase diagram for this device, and ﬁnd that it
can alternatively act as an eraser of information. We discuss our model in the context of the second
law of thermodynamics.
PACS numbers:
In a thought experiment highlighting the statistical
nature of the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell
imagined a tiny creature acting as a gatekeeper between
two chambers ﬁlled with gases at diﬀerent temperatures.
By preferentially allowing fast-moving molecules to pass
from the cold to the hot chamber, and slow ones to pass
in the other direction, this creature achieves refrigeration
without expending energy. As Maxwell put it: “the hot
system has got hotter and the cold colder and yet no work
has been done, only the intelligence of a very observant
and neat-ﬁngered being has been employed” [1].
In this Letter we propose a simple, solvable model of
a physical device that accomplishes the same result as
Maxwell’s intelligent and observant creature: it creates a
ﬂow of energy against a thermal gradient, without the in-
put of external work. Our device is a classical two-state
system that interacts with a pair of thermal reservoirs
and a memory register, which we model as a stream of
bits (Fig. 1(a)). The dynamics consist of stochastic tran-
sitions, by means of which the device exchanges energy
with the reservoirs and modiﬁes the states of the bits.
For appropriate values of the model parameters, these
dynamics produce a steady state in which there is a con-
tinual ﬂow of energy from the cold reservoir to the hot
reservoir, and a record of the system’s microscopic evo-
lution is continually written to the stream of bits. Our
device is fully autonomous, requiring no intervention by
an external agent. Its ability to control the ﬂow of energy
between the reservoirs emerges entirely from the micro-
scopic equations of motion.
The term “Maxwell’s demon” has come to refer not
only to the original setting described by Maxwell, but
more generally to any situation in which a rectiﬁcation
of microscopic ﬂuctuations produces a decrease of ther-
modynamic entropy [2, 3]. A consensus has emerged that
a physical device could achieve such a result, without vi-
olating the second law, if it were simultaneously to write
information to a memory register [4–8]. In this view,
the act of writing increases the information entropy of
the memory register, thereby compensating the decrease
of thermodynamic entropy produced by the device. If
the information is later erased from the memory regis-
ter, then by Landauer’s principle [4, 9] there must be an
increase in thermodynamic entropy elsewhere. This tidy
accounting places the Shannon entropy of a sequence of
bits on the same thermodynamic footing as the Clausius
entropy, deﬁned in terms of heat and temperature. As
long as the sum of these entropies never decreases, the
second law remains satisﬁed. See, however, Refs. [10–
13] for dissenting perspectives, which suggest that this
consensus is at best an appealing narrative based on the
presupposition of the second law, rather than an inde-
pendent explanation.
Maxwell’s demon has recently enjoyed increased at-
tention in a broad range of settings, including artiﬁ-
cial molecular machines [14], single photon cooling of
atoms [15], biomolecular signal transduction [16], quan-
tum information theory [17] and the feedback control of
microscopic ﬂuctuations [18–33]. Maxwell’s nineteenth-
century thought experiment has become a touchstone
for discussing the thermodynamic implications of infor-
mation processing by physical systems [34–37]. While
the consensus described above has identiﬁed and clari-
ﬁed these implications, far less eﬀort has been devoted
to uncovering precisely how a physical device, acting on
its own, might accomplish the same result as Maxwell’s
hypothetical being [38–43]. To the best of our knowl-
edge, the autonomous model we introduce below is the
ﬁrst to generate a ﬂow of energy against a thermal gra-
dient, eﬀectively acting as a refrigerator without a power
supply – just as in the setup considered by Maxwell, but
with the intelligent creature replaced by a dumb device.
This contrasts with an earlier model of a device that acts
as an engine, supplying work by extracting heat from
a single thermal reservoir [40]. Our autonomous frame-
work also diﬀers from that of Refs. [18–33] (including the

FIG. 1: (a) The device, or “demon”, interacts with a se-
quence of bits, one at a time, while exchanging energy with
two thermal reservoirs. (b) The demon makes intrinsic transi-

experimental realization reported in Ref. [26]), in which
external intervention in the form of measurement and
feedback is a key element.
In what follows we describe our model and analyze its
dynamics. We obtain a nonequilibrium phase diagram for
the steady state behavior (Fig. 2), which reveals that our
device can act either as a refrigerator, transferring energy
from a cold to a hot reservoir, or as an eraser, decreasing
the information content of the memory register. Finally,
we brieﬂy discuss our model in the context of the second
law of thermodynamics.
Our model consists of four components, sketched in
Fig. 1(a): a memory register, two thermal reservoirs at
temperatures Tc and Th > Tc, and a device that plays
the role of Maxwell’s demon. The memory register is
a sequence of bits (two-state systems) spaced at equal
intervals along a tape that slides frictionlessly past the
demon. The demon interacts with the nearest bit and
with the reservoirs, as we describe in detail in the follow-
ing paragraphs.
The demon itself is a two-state system, with states
u and d characterized by an energy diﬀerence ∆E =
Eu − Ed > 0. It can make random transitions between
these two states by exchanging energy with the hot reser-
voir, as illustrated by the vertical arrows in Fig. 1(b).
We will refer to these as intrinsic transitions, to empha-
size that they involve the demon but not the bits. The
corresponding transition rates satisfy the requirement of
detailed balance [1],
Rd→u
Rd←u
= e−βh∆E , (1)
where βh = 1/kTh and k is Boltzmann’s constant. We
parametrize these rates as
Rd→u = γ(1 − σ), Rd←u = γ(1 + σ), σ = tanh βh∆E
2(2)
where γ > 0 sets a characteristic rate for these transi-
tions, and 0 < σ < 1.
Each bit has two states, 0 and 1, with equal ener-
gies. We assume there are no intrinsic transitions be-
tween these two states. That is, the state of the bit can
change only via interaction with the demon, as we now
discuss.
At any instant in time, the demon interacts only with
nearest bit. As a result, it interacts sequentially with
the bits as they pass by. The duration of interaction
with each bit is τ = l/v, where l is the spacing between
bits and v is the constant speed of the tape. During one
such interaction interval, the demon and the nearest bit
can make cooperative transitions: if the bit is in state 0
and the demon is in state d, then they can simultane-
ously ﬂip to states 1 and u, and vice-versa (Fig. 1(b),
diagonal arrows). We will use the notation 0d ↔ 1u to
denote these transitions, which are accompanied by an
exchange of energy with the cold reservoir. The corre-
sponding transition rates again satisfy detailed balance,
R0d→1u/R0d←1u = e−βc∆E , where βc = 1/kTc, and we
will parametrize them as follows [45]
R0d→1u = 1 − ω, R0d←1u = 1 + ω, ω = tanh βc∆E
2 ,
(3)
with 0 < ω < 1. For later convenience, we also deﬁne
 = ω − σ
1 − ωσ = tanh (βc − βh)∆E
2 , (4)
whose value, 0 <  < 1, quantiﬁes the temperature dif-
ference between the two reservoirs.
Finally, we assume that the incoming bit stream con-
tains a mixture of 0’s and 1’s, with probabilities p0 and
p1, respectively, with no correlations between bits. Let
δ ≡ p0 − p1 (5)
denote the proportional excess of 0’s among incoming
bits.
We thus have the following dynamics. When a fresh
bit arrives to interact with the demon, its state is 0 or
1. The demon and bit subsequently interact for a time
τ , making the transitions shown in Fig. 1(b), thereby ex-
changing energy with the reservoirs. The state of the bit
at the end of the interaction interval is then preserved
as the bit joins the outgoing stream, and the next bit in
the sequence moves in to have its turn with the demon.
The parameters γ, σ and ω deﬁne the intrinsic and coop-
erative transition rates (Eqs. 2, 3), τ gives the duration
of interaction with each bit, and δ speciﬁes the statistics
of the incoming bits. Under these dynamics, the demon
evolves to a periodic steady state, in which its behavior
is statistically the same from one interaction interval to
the next.
Before proceeding to the solution of these dynamics,
we discuss heuristically how our model can achieve the
systematic transfer of heat from the cold to the hot reser-
voir. For this purpose let us assume that each incoming
3
bit is in state 0, hence δ = 1. At the start of a particu-
lar interaction interval, the joint state of the demon and
newly arrived bit is either 0u or 0d. The demon and bit
then evolve together for a time τ , according to the tran-
sitions shown in Fig. 1(b). If the joint state at the end
of the interaction interval is 0u or 0d, then it must be
the case that every transition 0d → 1u was balanced by
a transition 0d ← 1u, hence no net energy was absorbed
from the cold reservoir. If the ﬁnal state is 1u or 1d,
then we can infer that there was one net transition from
0d to 1u, and a quantity of energy ∆E was absorbed from
the cold reservoir. This amounts to thermal rectiﬁcation:
over the course of one interaction interval, energy can be
withdrawn from the cold reservoir but not delivered to
it. Moreover, a record of this process is imprinted in the
bit stream, as every outgoing bit in state 1 indicates the
absorption of energy ∆E from the cold reservoir. Since
the demon also exchanges energy with the hot reservoir,
and since energy cannot accumulate indeﬁnitely within
the demon, in the long run we get a net ﬂux of energy
from the cold to the hot reservoir, proportional to the
rate at which 1’s appear in the outgoing bit stream.
More generally, if the incoming bit stream contains a
mixture of 0’s and 1’s, then an excess of 0’s (that is,
δ > 0) produces a statistical bias that favors the ﬂow of
heat from the cold to the hot reservoir, while an excess of
1’s (δ < 0) produces the opposite bias. This bias either
competes with or enhances the normal thermodynamic
bias due to the temperature diﬀerence between the two
reservoirs. The demon thus aﬀects the ﬂow of energy be-
tween the reservoirs, and modiﬁes the states of the bits in
the memory register. We now investigate quantitatively
the interplay between these two eﬀects.
Once the demon has reached its periodic steady state,
let p′
0 and p′
1 denote the fractions of 0’s and 1’s in the
outgoing bit stream, and let δ′ = p′
0 −p′
1 denote the excess
of outgoing 0’s. Then
Φ ≡ p′
1 − p1 = δ − δ′
2 (6)
represents the average production of 1’s per interaction
interval in the outgoing bit stream, relative to the incom-
ing bit stream. Since each transition 0 → 1 is accompa-
nied by the absorption of energy ∆E from the cold reser-
voir (Fig. 1(b)), the average transfer of energy from the
cold to the hot reservoir, per interaction interval, is given
by
Qc→h = Φ∆E . (7)
A positive value of Qc→h indicates that our device pumps
energy against a thermal gradient, like the creature imag-
ined by Maxwell.
To quantify the information-processing capability of
the demon, let
S(δ) = −
1∑
i=0
pi ln pi = − 1 − δ
2 ln 1 − δ
2 − 1 + δ
2 ln 1 + δ
2
(8)
denote the information content, per bit, of the incoming
bit stream, and deﬁne S(δ′) by the same equation, for
the outgoing bit stream. Then
∆SB ≡ S(δ′) − S(δ) = S(δ − 2Φ) − S(δ) (9)
provides a measure of the extent to which the demon in-
creases the information content of the memory register.
We will interpret a positive value of ∆SB to indicate that
the demon writes information to the bit stream, while a
negative value indicates erasure. (More precisely, since
S(δ′) neglects the small correlations that arise between
the outgoing bits, ∆SB reﬂects the change in the Shan-
non information of the marginal probability distribution
of each outgoing bit.)
From Eqs. 7 and 9 we see that Φ determines both
Qc→h and ∆SB . In the Supplemental Material, we show
that under the dynamics we have described, the demon
reaches a periodic steady state, determined by the model
parameters Λ ≡ (δ, σ, γ, ω, τ ), in which
Φ(Λ) = δ − 
2 η(Λ) , η > 0 (10)
and
Qc→h(βh − βc) + ∆SB ≥ 0 . (11)
Eq. 11 is a strict inequality when δ 6 = . An explicit
expression for η(Λ) is given in the Supplemental Material,
but for our present purposes the crucial point is that the
sign of Φ is the same as that of δ − . We can think of
two eﬀective forces: the bias induced by the incoming bit
stream, which favors Φ > 0 when δ > 0 (as discussed
above), and the temperature gradient, quantiﬁed by ,
which favors Φ < 0 (Eq. 7). When these compete, the
winner is determined by the diﬀerence δ − .
Eq. 10 is obtained by solving for the periodic steady
state of the demon, using a linear-algebraic approach.
Eq. 11 is obtained by constructing a Lyapunov function
for the demon and interacting bit. The details of these
derivations are provided in the Supplemental Material.
Here, we instead use these results to investigate the be-
havior of our model in the periodic steady state. To that
end, we ﬁx γ and ω and construct a phase diagram that
illustrates the dependence on δ and , for various values
of τ , shown in Fig. 2. Let us consider the diﬀerent regions
of this diagram, working our way from right to left.
From Eqs. 7 and 10 it follows that Qc→h > 0 when
δ > , shown as the most darkly shaded region in Fig. 2.
Here, a surplus of incoming 0’s prevails over the tempera-
ture diﬀerence and our demon generates a ﬂow of energy
4
FIG. 2: Phase diagram of our model at ﬁxed γ = 1 and ω =
1/2. The parameter δ speciﬁes the incoming bit statistics,
and  is a rescaled temperature diﬀerence (Eq. 4). In the
most darkly shaded region the demon acts as a refrigerator
(Qc→h > 0), while in the lightly shaded regions it acts as an
eraser (∆SB < 0). The left boundary of the eraser region is
shown for τ = 0.1, 1.0, 2.0 and ∞. In the blank region at the
lower left, our model exhibits neither behavior (see text).
from the cold to the hot reservoir. Moreover, Eq. 11 re-
veals that ∆SB > 0 in this region (since βh < βc). This
agrees with the consensus described earlier: in order for a
physical device to act in the manner of Maxwell’s demon,
it must write information to a physical memory register.
In this sense, a bit stream with a low information con-
tent can be viewed as a thermodynamic resource, which
can be expended (by writing to the available memory) in
order to achieve refrigeration.
Now consider the region  > δ > 0, in which the sur-
plus of 0’s in the incoming bit stream is not suﬃcient
to overcome the temperature gradient, and energy ﬂows
from the hot to the cold reservoir. Since Φ < 0 we get
δ′ > δ > 0 (Eq. 6). This in turn implies ∆SB < 0, as
S(δ) is a concave function with a maximum at δ = 0.
In this region the demon acts as an eraser, lowering the
information content of the bit stream, but the price paid
for this erasure is the passage of heat from the hot to the
cold reservoir.
In the region δ < 0, energy ﬂows from the hot to the
cold reservoir (Eqs. 7, 10), but the value of ∆SB depends
on all the model parameters. In Fig. 2, for four diﬀerent
values of τ , we show the line corresponding to ∆SB = 0.
To the right of this line we have ∆SB < 0 and to the left
we have ∆SB > 0. In the limit τ → ∞, the boundary
between these two behaviors approaches the line  = −δ.
Examining the phase diagram as a whole, we see that
in the shaded regions our model reaches a steady state
in which one thermodynamic resource is replenished at
the expense of another. Either energy is pumped against
a thermal gradient at the cost of writing information to
memory (the refrigerator regime), or else memory is made
available, by erasure, at the expense of allowing energy
to ﬂow from the hot to the cold reservoir (the eraser
regime). The boundary between these two behaviors is
the line δ = . In the unshaded region at the far left,
both resources are consumed, as energy ﬂows down the
thermal gradient and information is written to the bit
stream.
Finally, to place our model within the context of the
second law of thermodynamics, note that the ﬁrst term
on the left side of Eq. 11 is the steady-state change in
thermodynamic entropy due to the ﬂow of heat, and the
second term is the change in information entropy, per
interaction interval. Eq. 11 can be viewed as a mod-
iﬁed Clausius inequality, in which the information en-
tropy of a random sequence of data is explicitly assigned
the same thermodynamic status as the physical entropy
associated with the transfer of heat. (More precisely,
Eq. 11 is a weak version of this inequality, as we neglect
correlations among the outgoing bits; see Supplemental
Material.) Thus our model provides support for the con-
sensus mentioned earlier [4–6], and Eq. 11 is consistent
with Landauer’s principle [4], which states that a ther-
modynamic cost must be paid for the erasure of memory.
However, in Ref. [4] this cost appears as the dissipation
of energy into a single thermal reservoir, whereas in our
model it is the transfer of energy from a hot to a cold
reservoir.
In summary, we have constructed a simple, solvable
model of an autonomous physical system that mimics
the behavior of the “neat-ﬁngered being” in Maxwell’s
thought experiment, generating a systematic ﬂow of en-
ergy against a thermal gradient without the input of ex-
ternal work. While Maxwell’s creature accomplishes this
with intelligence, our inanimate device requires only a
memory register to which information can be written.
Alternatively, it can harness the ﬂow of energy from hot
to cold in order to erase information from the register.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Solving for Φ(Λ)
Solving for Φ involves ﬁrst solving for the periodic steady state of the demon, then using that solution to determine
the distribution of the outgoing bits, from which Φ follows by Eq. 6 of the main text. We will use the notation pD =
(pu, pd)T (where the superscript T indicates transpose) to denote the statistical state of the demon, pB = (p0, p1)T
for that of the interacting bit, and p = (pu0, pd0, pu1, pd1)T to denote their joint probability distribution.
Let T denote the 2 × 2 transition matrix whose element Tµν (µ, ν ∈ {u, d}) gives the probability for the demon to
be in state µ at the end of an interaction interval, given that it was in state ν at the start of the interval. As explained
below, this matrix can be written as the product
T = PD eRτ M, (12)
where
PD =
( 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
)
, R =




• γ(1 − σ) 0 0
γ(1 + σ) • 1 + ω 0

 , M =




p0 0
0 p0
p1 0
0 p1



 . (13)
Here R is the transition rate matrix for the demon and the interacting bit. Its oﬀ-diagonal elements are given by
Eqs. 2 and 3 of the main text, and its diagonal elements are determined by the requirement that the elements in
each column sum to zero [1]. To understand Eq. 12, let pD
0 denote the distribution of the demon at the start of a
given interaction interval. Then p0 = MpD
0 gives the initial joint distribution of the demon and the incoming bit.
6
From this initial, uncorrelated state the joint distribution evolves under the master equation dp/dt = Rp, therefore
pτ = exp (Rτ )MpD
0 gives the joint distribution at the end of the interaction interval. The matrix PD then projects
out the state of the bit, thus pD
τ = PD exp (Rτ )MpD
0 = T pD
0 gives the ﬁnal marginal distribution of the demon.
The evolution of the demon over many intervals is given by repeated application of the matrix T . Because T is a
positive transition matrix [2], the demon evolves to a periodic steady state,

0 gives the marginal distribution of the demon at the start of each interaction interval.
In the periodic steady state, the joint distribution of the demon and the interacting bit, at the end of the interaction
interval, is given by pps
τ = exp (Rτ )MpD,ps
0 . The marginal distribution of the outgoing bit is then given by projecting
out the state of the demon:
pB,ps
τ = PB eRτ MpD,ps
0 , PB ≡

)
. (16)
Therefore, to solve for Φ, we ﬁrst compute the elements of T using Eq. 12, then ﬁnd its right eigenstate pD,ps
0
(Eq. 15), then determine pB,ps
τ = (p′
0, p′
1)T using Eq. 16. Φ then follows directly from Eq. 6 in the main text:
Φ = p′

We performed these calculations using Mathematica [3], and then simpliﬁed the results substantially by hand,
ﬁnally obtaining
Φ = δ − 
2 η(Λ) , η(Λ) = ν2P + ν3Q
P + Q , (17a)
P = µ2 (µ4ν3 + µ1ν1) , Q = µ3 (µ4ν2 + µ1ν1),
ν1 = 1 − e−2γ τ , µ1 = (δ + σ) ω,
ν2 = 1 − e−(1+γ−α) τ , µ2 = α + γ + σ ω,
ν3 = 1 − e−(1+γ+α) τ , µ3 = α − γ − σ ω,
α = √1 + γ2 + 2γσω , µ4 = 1 − δ ω.
(17b)
If the demon’s intrinsic transitions occur rapidly in comparison with the cooperative transitions, γ → ∞, then
the analysis simpliﬁes substantially: the demon remains in equilibrium with the hot reservoir at all times, and the
interacting bit obeys the master equation

with a = (1 − ω)(1 + σ)/2 and b = (1 + ω)(1 − σ)/2. Here pB
j (t) is the probability to ﬁnd the bit in state j ∈ {0, 1}
at time t during the interaction interval. Integrating Eq. 18 over one interaction interval, 0 ≤ t ≤ τ , then setting

As a consistency check, we note that this result also follows from our general solution, Eq. 17, with the expression for
η(Λ) evaluated in the limit γ → ∞.
Our general expression for η(δ, σ, γ, ω, τ ), while exact, is suﬃciently complex that we are unable to derive the
inequality η > 0 (which was crucial in our interpretation of the phase diagram in the main text) directly from Eq. 17.
Instead we will show in Appendix that this inequality follows from the modiﬁed Clausius inequality, Eq. 11 of the
main text, which we now derive.

Modiﬁed Clausius inequality
During any interaction interval, the joint distribution of the demon and the interacting bit evolves according to the
master equation discussed above,
dp
dt = Rp, (20)
where R is given in Eq. 13. For very long interaction intervals (τ → ∞), the combined system relaxes to the stationary
state
p = 1
N
(1, µ, µν, µ2ν)T , µ = 1 + σ
1 − σ , ν = 1 − ω
1 + ω , N = (1 + µ)(1 + µν) , (21)
which satisﬁes Rp = 0. Note that p is actually a product of marginal distributions pD and pB for the demon and
bit:
pij = pD
i pB
j , i ∈ {u, d}, j ∈ {0, 1}, (22a)
pD = (1, µ)T /(1 + µ), pB = (1, µν)T /(1 + µν). (22b)
The irreversible approach of p(t) toward p is described by the relative entropy [4],
D(p||p) = ∑
k
pk ln pk
pk
≥ 0 . (23)
Here and in what follows, we use the index k to indicate a joint state of the demon and the bit, k ∈ {0u, 0d, 1u, 1d},
reserving i and j for the demon and the bit, respectively, as in Eq. 22a. A standard calculation [1] shows that D is a
Lyapunov function, that is it satisﬁes
d
dt D(p||p) ≤ 0 , (24)
where the equality holds only when p = p. Thus, as measured by relative entropy, any initial p 6 = p evolves
monotonically toward p, although for ﬁnite interaction intervals this relaxation is interrupted by the arrival of the
next bit. We now use these properties to derive the inequality
Qc→h(βh − βc) + ∆SB ≥ 0 , (25)
which appears as Eq. 11 of the main text.
Let p0 and pτ denote the joint distributions of the demon and a bit at the beginning and end of a given interaction
interval, respectively, and similarly deﬁne pD
0 , pD
τ , pB
0 and pB
τ for the marginal distributions of the demon and the
bit. Eq. 24 implies
D(p0||p) − D(pτ ||p) ≥ 0. (26)
Using Eqs. 23 and 22a we rewrite the left side of this equation as
Sτ − S0 − ∑
i∈{u,d}
(pD

0,i
) ln pD
i − ∑
j∈{0,1}
(pB
τ,j − pB

) ln pB
j , (27)
where S0 = − ∑
k p0,k ln p0,k and Sτ = − ∑
k pτ,k ln pτ,k are the information entropies of the joint distributions of the
demon and the bit at the beginning and end of the interaction interval. Let us now evaluate Eq. 27, assuming the
demon has reached its periodic steady state.
The joint entropy S can be written as [4]
S = SD + SB − I(D; B) , I(D; B) ≥ 0, (28)
where SD is the marginal entropy of the demon, SB is the marginal entropy of the bit, and the mutual information
I(D; B) quantiﬁes the degree of correlation between them. By construction, the demon and bit are uncorrelated at
8
the start of the interaction interval, hence I0(D; B) = 0. In the periodic steady state we have SD
τ = SD
0 , because
the demon starts and ends in the same distribution. Hence the diﬀerence Sτ − S0 in Eq. 27 can be replaced by
∆SB − Iτ (D; B). We also have pD
0 = pD
τ in the periodic steady state, so the ﬁrst sum appearing in Eq. 27 vanishes.
Once the period steady state has been reached, the bit distributions pB
0 and pB
τ correspond to the statistics of the
incoming and outgoing bit streams, deﬁned in the main text:
pB
0,j = pj , pB
τ,j = p′
j , j ∈ {0, 1} , (29)
hence pB
τ,0 − pB
0,0 = −(pB
τ,1 − pB
0,1) = Φ, from the deﬁnition of Φ. The last term in Eq. 27 can now be rewritten, using
Eq. 21 and Eqs. 2 and 3 of the main text, as
− ∑
j∈{0,1}
(pB
τ,j − pB
0,j
) ln pB
j = Φ ln(µν) = Qc→h(βh − βc). (30)
Collecting these results, we get
D(p0||p) − D(pτ ||p) = ∆SB − Iτ (D; B) + Qc→h(βh − βc), (31)
which then combines with Eq. 26 to give us
Qc→h(βh − βc) + ∆SB ≥ Iτ (D; B) ≥ 0. (32)
An alternative derivation of this result can be constructed using the integral ﬂuctuation theorem for total entropy
production [5].
The ﬁrst inequality in Eq. 32 is stronger than the modiﬁed Clausius statement, Eq. 25. This underscores the fact
that Eq. 25 is a weak statement of the second law of thermodynamics (as it applies to our model), since it neglects
correlations in the outgoing bits: the quantity ∆SB is deﬁned in terms of the marginal distribution of each bit. In
reality the bits do develop correlations via their interactions with the demon, as the state of the demon at the end of
one interaction interval is also its initial state at the beginning of the next interval. (Explicit numerical simulations
indicate that these correlations are small, but not zero.) If these correlations were to be taken into account, then the
net change in the Shannon entropy per bit would have a value slightly lower than ∆SB , and Eq. 25 would be replaced
by a somewhat stronger bound. These considerations are reﬂected, somewhat indirectly, by the term Iτ (D; B) in
Eq. 32.
Finally, note that

= 1 − δ
1 + δ , (33)
using Eqs. 21 and 22b, and the deﬁnitions of  and σ. Thus, when δ = , the incoming bits arrive in the stationary
distribution p. In this case, no relaxation occurs during the interaction interval; the equality holds in Eqs. 24 and
26; the outgoing bits depart with the same distribution; and Φ = 0. When δ 6 = , Eqs. 24 and 26 are both strict
inequalities, and therefore so is the modiﬁed Clausius inequality (Eq. 25 / Eq. 11).
Positivity of η(Λ)
To investigate the sign of η, let us take δ 6 =  [6] and rewrite Eq. 25 in the form
f (δ′) > f (δ) , (34)
where
f (δ) = Kδ + S(δ) , K = 1
2 (βc − βh)∆E > 0. (35)
Eq. 34 follows by the direct substitution of the relations
Qc→h = Φ∆E , Φ = δ − δ′
2 , ∆SB = S(δ′) − S(δ) (36)

into Eq. 25, using a strict inequality since δ 6 = .
By construction, d2f /dδ2 < 0. Setting df /dδ = 0, the unique maximum of f (δ) is easily shown to occur at δ = ,
as illustrated in Fig. 3(a) for  = 1/3. Now let δ1 and δ2 denote two values of δ that correspond to the same value
of f , with δ2 <  < δ1, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Let δ′
1 describe the surplus of 0’s in the outgoing bit stream, when
the incoming stream is characterized by δ1. Because the maximum of f (δ) occurs at δ = , Eq. 34 implies that
δ2 < δ′
1 < δ1; see Fig. 3(b). If we instead consider incoming and outgoing bit streams described by δ2 and δ′
2, then the
same argument gives us δ2 < δ′
2 < δ1. We therefore conclude that the incoming and outgoing bit streams necessarily
satisfy
sign(δ − δ′) = sign(δ − ) , (37)
in other words δ′ lies on the same side as  with respect to δ. Since
δ − δ′
2 = Φ = δ − 
2 η(Λ) , (38)
we must have η(Λ) > 0.
