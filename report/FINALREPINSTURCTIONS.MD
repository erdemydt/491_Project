Instructions for writing the final report: 
0. Everything, including the used Code should be in a seperate directory called final-report, with Code etc. directories. If any modification is needed to a .py file, its investigation and modification should be done in this folder. No mention of phases, for codes, we can just have the section names, one state, n state, 2-bit interacting (demon)
1. The base report is the report.tex, the progress report, in this here folder. This report's original content must mostly remain unchanged, with only the following changes: 
    * The introduction & the abstract will need a small modification after everything has been done, to tell the whole story of the report.
    * The first part where we discuss the 1-state demon, we should add a new subsection to define, describe, then demonstrate the stacked demons, increasing the K gives the same result as increasing tau, which we will be able to show using the code in the phase_7 folder, and we should show the comparison in detail and argue that by adding more demons, we would be able to get a good result without slowing the tape down (same as increasing tau) 
    * In the N-state demon part, the discussion about Delta_E will be completely different, we shall delete the delta_E vs. phi plot and talk about, how in a latter-state demon, one could define the transition rate between states the same or have the same T_C and T_H as before, which would lead to confusion with dimensions in the disscussion. Thus, the already included plot represents how the results would be if we went ahead and moved away from sigma & omega as our basis and used the same T_C, T_H with low deltaE between states which is the main reason of the increasing phi, going near .5. We shall add a new plot that shows for a lattered Demon, with each state having the same sigma omega for their transition rates as the before cases (mentioned in the already included plot descriptions) then comment on it. The code in the phase_7 folder should be enough of a base to use for generating this plot, even though we wont be using stacking.
    * The Future Work section should be deleted, as this itself is the future work. 

2. Another section for the 2-bit interacting demon should be added (phase_10 folder), and it should be throughly described with its purpose and what it could do etc. etc.. appropriate plots should be generated using the phase_10 folder code as a base, and then used and commented on in the final report. You might want to try it out without the plots to get what the results give and then generate the plots and comment on it. So, understand the results, generate plots, comment.
